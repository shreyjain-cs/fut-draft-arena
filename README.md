#FootDraft Ultimateâš½

About The Project
FootDraft was created to provide football enthusiasts with an immersive and realistic draft experience. Users can create a league, invite friends, and take turns selecting players from a comprehensive database based on FC 25 stats. The goal was to build a clean, fast, and intuitive interface for the ultimate fantasy draft.
